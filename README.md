# Overview

This software is a “To Do List” application that will allow users to view, add, edit and remove their tasks.
This project is my attempt to stretch my knowledge by learning enough about Rust to be able to build the present application and learn new concepts.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)
* Rustup (Tool to install and manage Rust)

# Useful Websites

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

* Refactor the Code to reuse some of the code (apply the DRY principle)
* Remove the extra functions used to Update the Task instances values
* Use the UUID crate to generate random Ids for Task instances Id
